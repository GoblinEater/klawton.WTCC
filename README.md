# klawton.github.io
Git Repository for WTCC
I am Keith Lawton. kalawton@my.waketech.edu
My GitHub account was created a short while ago. I was very unsure of what I was doing at the time and it is still in a bit of disarray. I set it up as my cybersec name, Goblin Eater, so it may look a little weird. I assure you, it is me.
The repository I have created is kalawton.github.io. It reflects as neatly as possible my identity at Wake Tech where I am starting to learn some great things. This repository will be where I create work for the classes and begin my real GitHub work. Today is a great day :)
The steps I took were to log in to my online GitHub account and create a new repository for this class. I then downloaded the GitHub desktop application and logged into my GitHub account. 
Once the account was connected, I cloned the WTCC GitHub repository and placed it in Documents>GIT on my laptop. Here I can edit the files, which I did to update the README.md file.
