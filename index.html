    <h1>My Name Is Keith</h1>
    <p>I am a student at Wake Tech Community College who is looking to change career focus. I have been in networking most of my life and have fulfilled many roles along the way. <br><br>
    Although I have been in a very technical environment, I have found that my skills, although good, have stayed too generic to be of value any longer. So, I have chosen to focus on cybersecurity as it mixes both human and technical operations into a juicy amalgam of investigation, puzzling, and mental jousting. 
    <br><br>
    Cybersecurity brings many challenges as it is still a fairly new space. Many features and functions are still being developed, and improved, and updated to work as predicted. At the same time, malicious actors are always working to find a new way into otherwise prohibited places, and often with very different motives.</p>
